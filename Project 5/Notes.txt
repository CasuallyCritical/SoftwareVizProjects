Notes on the connection nodes in the force layout:

-The more frequently linked nodes are thicker than less frequently linked.
  -Example: The Jets have one node, and it's incredibly thin
    Conversely, the patriots nodes are incredibly thickened with how frequently they appear in the superbowl.
    
The super_bowl_nfl.json file contains
  -All 32 NFL teams by their current name
  -All 56 super bowls, chronologically sorted.
  
Things that can be done for improvement:
  -Highlighting links to point out what year these events happen
  -Adding a category for what the score was beteween that game
  -Highlighting by team
  -Showing win loss records for each team.
